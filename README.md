# SH-task-two
Week's two task

Please It's preffered to run the task on a physical device and not an emulator, because some emulators have their location disabled.. and the application requires it because it makes use of live location tracking
although it asks for permission before using the location.. even if permission is granted and location is turned off.. it'll still break..

please use the android and ios files too.. Thy're needed to ask for permission based on what platform is being used
and the pubspec file for the dependencies

Git Guardian Keeps Complaining about my open api key(open weather api)..
hopefully it does"nt get blocked

Thank You...
